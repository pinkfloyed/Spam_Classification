## Spam_Classification
- This project trains a ###DistilBERT model for spam message detection using the SMSSpamCollection dataset.
- The text data is preprocessed, tokenized, and used to fine-tune the model for binary classification (spam vs. ham).
- After training for 2 epochs, the model achieves a 99.28% accuracy and 0.0195 loss on the test set.
- A confusion matrix is generated, showing strong performance with minimal false positives and negatives.
- The trained model is saved for future use.
